<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerous studies have explored the cognitive advantages of bilingualism,
highlighting its potential to enhance various cognitive abilities. Understanding these
associations can help educators and parents support bilingual students in leveraging their
cognitive strengths to achieve their full potential. However, the relationship between
bilingualism and computational thinking (CT) remains under-researched. The purpose of this
study is to investigate whether bilingualism predicts higher computational thinking
performance, using hierarchical regression analysis on data from the U.S. sample of the
International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018. Results revealed that
after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status,
computer experience, and self-efficacy in information and communications technology,
bilingual students scored lower on computational thinking tests than their monolingual peers.
These findings challenge the notion of cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism,
suggesting that its benefits may not extend to all cognitive domains. Furthermore, the study
identifies limitations in current measures of bilingual status and calls for future research to
examine how the complexity of bilingual experiences influences diverse cognitive skills.

**Cross-Language Reading-Writing Project**

PI: [Dr. Ye Shen](https://www.usf.edu/education/faculty/faculty-profiles/ye-shen.aspx) 

This project utilized standardized assessments to measure the biliteracy skills of Mandarin Chinese heritage language learners aged 8 to 12, exploring the relationship between reading and writing skills within and across Mandarin and English. The purpose was to deepen understanding of cross-linguistic influences and promote biliteracy development among heritage language learners.

**Mother-Child Talk Project**

PI: [Dr. Becky Huang](https://ehe.osu.edu/teaching-and-learning/directory?id=huang.5088) 

This project investigated how maternal language shapes young children's language development. In a controlled lab setting, children aged 3 to 5 and their mothers engaged in conversations about emotions such as sadness, happiness, anger, and fear. These conversations were analyzed using the Computerized Language Analysis (CLAN) tool to explore how maternal language input influences children's language production. By focusing on these early interactions, the study aimed to uncover the role of maternal input in developing young children's language skills and emotional understanding.

**Kinship Oral Health Project**

PI: [Dr. Nancy Mendoza](https://csw.osu.edu/faculty/mendoza-nancy-ph-d/) 

In the United States, kinship families often form when parents face challenges such as substance abuse, domestic violence, incarceration, serious illness, or death. This project evaluated the needs and benefits of school-based dental services for kinship families by surveying caregivers with experience using these programs. The findings highlighted how these services address the unique challenges faced by kinship families, reduce health disparities and racial inequities, and improve children's dental health within these families. The project emphasized the importance of integrating school-based dental services into all school-based healthcare programs to ensure broader access and equitable care.
