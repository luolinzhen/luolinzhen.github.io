<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerous studies have explored the cognitive advantages of bilingualism,
highlighting its potential to enhance various cognitive abilities. Understanding these
associations can help educators and parents support bilingual students in leveraging their
cognitive strengths to achieve their full potential. However, the relationship between
bilingualism and computational thinking (CT) remains under-researched. The purpose of this
study is to investigate whether bilingualism predicts higher computational thinking
performance, using hierarchical regression analysis on data from the U.S. sample of the
International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018. Results revealed that
after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status,
computer experience, and self-efficacy in information and communications technology,
bilingual students scored lower on computational thinking tests than their monolingual peers.
These findings challenge the notion of cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism,
suggesting that its benefits may not extend to all cognitive domains. Furthermore, the study
identifies limitations in current measures of bilingual status and calls for future research to
examine how the complexity of bilingual experiences influences diverse cognitive skills.
